The Bank also has a discretionary Career Leave Policy (Career Leave requires an individual to resign from the Bank).\n4: When you can take leave\nLeave can be requested electronically via One Bank Service and must be approved by your manager before you can take it.\nYour manager will endeavour to allow you to take leave on the dates you request, but there may be times when this is not possible. You should always confirm your leave before making firm holiday bookings/personal arrangements.\nAs a general rule you will be expected to take a minimum of two weeks of your annual leave entitlement consecutively (mainly in the interests of your health).\n5: Accrual\nYour core leave and any entitlement to additional leave accrue proportionately from day to day. Core leave cannot be anticipated from the next Benefits Year.\n6: Salary in lieu of leave on termination\nOn the termination of your employment you will either:\na) be entitled to salary in lieu of any outstanding pro rata core and additional leave entitlement (other than where your employment is terminated under clause 11.2 of Part B or where you leave the Bank without giving due notice in which case you would only be entitled to payment for accrued statutory leave), or\nb) (regardless of the reason for termination) be required to repay to the Bank any salary received in respect of core or additional leave taken in excess of your pro rata leave entitlement.",
    "gold_answer": "If you have unused pro-rata core/additional leave, you’re generally paid salary in lieu; if you have taken more than your entitlement, you must repay the excess. (Exceptions apply if terminated under clause 11.2 of Part B or if you leave without due notice.)"
